              <h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
              <p>
                A cookie is a small text file stored in your web browser that
                allows the Site or a third party to recognize you. Cookies may
                be used for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Enabling certain functions</li>
                <li>Providing analytics</li>
                <li>Storing preferences</li>
                <li>Enabling ad delivery and behavioral advertising</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div className="mt-3">
              <p>
                Cookies can be session cookies (which expire when you close your
                browser) or persistent cookies (which remain until they expire
                or you delete them). Cookies placed by the site you’re visiting
                are "first-party cookies", while those placed by other entities
                are "third-party cookies."
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies often work with pixel tags (web beacons or clear GIFs)
                to measure visitor actions. For example, pixel tags may track
                interactions on the site or referrals to partners, for
                re-targeting or interest-based advertising as explained in
                section 5 below.
